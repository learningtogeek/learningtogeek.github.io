# Rationale
During my time in IT/System Operations, I have used a general format for the documentation that I created. The first section I always called Rationale. My reasoning was twofold:

1. I wanted the first piece of information that a person read to be the reason the article existed in the first place.
2. It gave a measure for both the reader and the author (me) as to whether the article would be considered a “mission accomplished.” If you read the article and it didn’t accomplish the Rationale then the article needed revision.

During my time as an IT system operations admin I have become more and more intrigued and convinced of the DevOps culture and framework of dealing with scenarios. I loved the idea of automation and using it to enhance availability, stability, and reliability (not to mention performance). Little did I know that I was thinking in the realm of site reliability engineering. There seemed just one major problem: I’m an ops admin, not a software engineer. I’m still convinced that a person from a solidly Ops world can transition into an architect or SRE role.

That is the purpose of this series of blog posts. I’m going to catalog my journey along these lines. Sometimes it will be longer posts, sometimes smaller quips. But I hope the reading is both informative and entertaining (because I can almost guarantee some dumb decisions that border on hilarity).

Thanks for stopping by.
